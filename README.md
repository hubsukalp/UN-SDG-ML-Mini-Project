# Comprehensive ML Analysis of UN SDG Data

This project performs a complete, end-to-end machine learning workflow on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) dataset from 2015-2024. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and the implementation of the three primary types of machine learning: **Regression**, **Clustering**, and **Classification**.

## üöÄ Key Models & Results

This project successfully trained and validated three separate ML models to answer different analytical questions.

### 1. Regression (Supervised Learning)
* **Goal:** To predict the numerical value of an SDG indicator.
* **Model:** `RandomForestRegressor`
* **Result:** **81.2% R-squared (R¬≤)**
* **Insight:** The model accurately predicts SDG values. The most important features were found to be the **Country** (`REF_AREA_LABEL`) and the **Year** (`TIME_PERIOD`).

### 2. Classification (Supervised Learning)
* **Model:** `RandomForestClassifier`
* **Goal:** To predict the performance category of an indicator ("Low", "Medium", or "High").
* **Result:** **85.7% Accuracy**
* **Insight:** The model can accurately classify an indicator's performance, with high precision and recall for all three classes.

### 3. Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
* **Model:** `K-Means Clustering`
* **Goal:** To find hidden groups of countries with similar SDG profiles.
* **Result:** **4 Distinct Country Clusters**
* **Insight:** The model successfully segmented 255 countries into logical, real-world groups, such as "High-Need, Aid-Reliant Nations" and "High Malnutrition (Overweight) Nations."

## üíª How to Run This Project

1.  **Environment:** This project is designed to be run in a **Google Colab** environment, as it includes steps for mounting Google Drive.

2.  **Get the Data:**
    * The raw dataset (`Raw Dataset_UN_SDG.csv`) is **not included** in this repository due to its large size (over 25MB).
    * You must download the raw dataset from its original source.
    * Upload `Raw Dataset_UN_SDG.csv` to your personal Google Drive.

3.  **Update Path:** Open the `Source_Code.ipynb` notebook and update the file path in **Part 2** to point to the file's location in your Google Drive.

4.  **Run Notebook:** Run the cells in the notebook sequentially from top to bottom.
    * **Part 1-6** will clean the data.
    * **Part 7-9** will run the **Regression** analysis.
    * **Part 10-11** will run the **Clustering** analysis.
    * **Part 12-13** will run the **Classification** analysis and show the final conclusion.
